> TL;DR  
> - **Docs welcome.** Use our raw-text style and keep content conceptual/safe.  
> - **No code PRs (for now).** Code is Proprietary/UNLICENSED; request exceptions via Issues.  
> - **Open a public Issue first** if anything might be sensitive: label it **Policy Review**.  
> - By contributing, you confirm you own your work and **license docs to us under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0** for inclusion in the repo.

## 1) Scope & Safety

**In-scope (public, civilian):**  
- Concept overviews, non-enabling theory, high-level architectures  
- Bench-safe demo ideas (low power, no targeting, no performance thresholds)  
- Materials/ethics/policy notes that improve safety and public understanding

**Out-of-scope (do not submit):**  
- ITAR/EAR-controlled technical data  
- Weaponization details, targeting algorithms, detailed geometries, timing/control specifics, performance parameters suitable for weapon integration  
- Sensitive coordinates, operational playbooks, or anything that could cause harm

When in doubt, open an Issue titled **[Policy Review] <topic>** before sharing details.
