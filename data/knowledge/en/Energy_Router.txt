Interference-Guided Thermal Distribution (Concept Overview)

This note summarizes a concept for distributing incident electromagnetic energy as heat across volume rather than concentrating it at a point. Instead of attempting to block or absorb a beam at a single location, the system shapes field interactions so the resulting thermal workload is spread through a benign reservoir medium inside a tessellated structure. The intent is to turn spikes into smooth loads.

Reservoir medium. A dielectric, gel-like thermal reservoir accepts transient energy and releases it over time. The medium is chosen for stability, high volumetric heat capacity, and compatibility with the surrounding structure.

Interference management. Field interactions are guided so energy deposition prefers volume over surface concentration. In effect, the structure encourages patterns that avoid localized hotspots and favor broad, recoverable thermal profiles.

Two use cases. (1) Directed energy (laser): the approach favors volumetric distribution to avoid point-source damage. (2) Broadband surges (e.g., solar activity): the approach buffers transient loads and maintains a stable operating envelope for protected components.

Integration. The method is compatible with tessellated, resonant architectures where many small elements cooperate to maintain stability. It emphasizes routing and distribution over brute blocking.

Scope. This is a conceptual overview intended for discussion and collaboration only. Implementation details (materials, geometries, drive methods, timing, and control strategies) are reserved.
