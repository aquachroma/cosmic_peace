INTERACTION 08 — SAFE SURFACE CONTACT
Approaching, Touching, and Traveling Beside a TESS-128 System
------------------------------------------------------------

INTRODUCTION
------------
This document describes how an ordinary person can safely
approach the outer boundary of a TESS-128 field and interact
with it at the human scale. The goal is to remove uncertainty,
ease first-contact experiences, and provide clear expectations
for what is normal, natural, and comfortable.

No technical mechanisms are disclosed. This is a behavioral
guide based entirely on public-facing interaction principles.

------------------------------------------------------------
1. WHAT THE SURFACE *FEELS* LIKE
------------------------------------------------------------

The “surface” is not a solid wall.
It is a *responsive boundary*—a gentle gradient where local
pressure, light diffusion, and micro-environmental cues blend
to create a consistent interaction layer.

Physically, it feels like this:

• A soft, cool presence  
• A slight reduction in turbulence  
• A sense that air pressure is evenly distributed  
• No shock, no force, no stickiness  
• A subtle “absence” of noise  

There is no static charge, heat, or vibration.  
Nothing jumps, pushes, or pulls.

Instead, the surface meets your hand the way calm water meets
your fingertips—yielding, accepting, and self-smoothing.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. HOW TO APPROACH THE BOUNDARY
------------------------------------------------------------

Approaching the surface is intuitive.

2.1 Walk normally
You do not need to slow down or wave your hands in front of you.
The field perceives your presence and adjusts without needing
attention.

2.2 The last meter feels different
You may notice:

• colors sharpen  
• airflow becomes smoother  
• your breathing feels slightly easier  

These are environmental stabilizers, not control signals.  
They mean you are being welcomed, not scanned.

2.3 Stopping distance
You can walk directly up to the surface and gently place your
hand on it. There is no risk of stepping “through” by accident.
You will feel its presence before you rely on it for balance.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. TOUCHING THE SURFACE
------------------------------------------------------------

Contact is safe, quiet, and immediately comfortable.  
People often describe it as:

• pressing into dense air  
• touching a temperature-neutral cushion  
• meeting a calm, buoyant resistance  

3.1 No force-feedback surprises  
There are no pulses, no jolts, and no reactive pushes.

3.2 The surface adapts to you  
If you rest your hand, it will support the weight without
stiffening. If you lean, the support diffuses smoothly, never
abruptly.

3.3 The surface never grips you  
It never closes around fingers, clothing, hair, or tools.

Touch is a one-way request:  
**you initiate, it accommodates.**

------------------------------------------------------------
4. WALKING BESIDE THE SURFACE
------------------------------------------------------------

A TESS-128 in motion provides a protective ambiance around its
perimeter. As it moves, the boundary maintains:

• a consistent standoff distance  
• a stable airflow corridor  
• a sound-softening buffer  
• predictable footstep traction  

You can walk beside it comfortably—like walking next to a
well-behaved service animal or gentle moving platform.

4.1 No suction or bow shock  
Movement does not create a vacuum pull or wind blast.

4.2 No blind spots  
The system perceives your presence from all angles and moves
with the grace of a trained companion.

4.3 Safe for children and pets  
The boundary responsively adjusts without startling or trapping.

------------------------------------------------------------
5. IS IT SAFE TO LEAN?
------------------------------------------------------------

Yes.

The surface is strong enough to support a person leaning
comfortably, yet soft enough to never feel rigid or mechanical.

You may:

• rest a hand  
• lean a shoulder  
• place a backpack  
• steady yourself during motion  

What you may *not* experience:

• sudden loss of support  
• stiffness  
• unpredictable resistance  

Leaning is normal.  
Many users instinctively trust the surface after a few seconds.

------------------------------------------------------------
6. HOW THE SURFACE RESPONDS TO GROUPS
------------------------------------------------------------

The boundary expands and adapts to group approaches without
becoming claustrophobic. It preserves:

• personal space  
• consistent lighting  
• airflow for every individual  
• clear paths for entry and exit  

If more than one person touches it simultaneously, each receives
individualized support—there is no “priority,” no crowding of
resources.

------------------------------------------------------------
7. BOARDING OR ENTERING (WHERE APPLICABLE)
------------------------------------------------------------

When a TESS-128 is configured for boarding or passenger
interaction, a controlled opening will form only when:

• you intentionally present yourself  
• the system confirms your stability  
• the environment is favorable  
• no conflicting safety loads exist  

This opening feels like stepping through a well-lit doorway, not
a membrane.

Entry is always opt-in.  
The system never draws you in or nudges you forward.

------------------------------------------------------------
8. WHAT TO EXPECT IF YOU ARE AN OBSERVER
------------------------------------------------------------

If you choose not to touch the surface, you will still notice:

• smoother air  
• quieter surroundings  
• slightly brighter colors  
• stabilized lighting  
• reduced glare  

These are environmental harmonizers—not control systems.

The surface exists to preserve clarity, not obscure reality.

------------------------------------------------------------
9. ACCESSIBILITY CONSIDERATIONS
------------------------------------------------------------

The boundary is designed for full inclusivity.

Wheelchairs, canes, walkers, and mobility aids all interact
without issue.

The system provides:

• flat pressure distribution  
• balanced light environment  
• predictable load paths  
• stabilized footing  

No specialized training is required.

------------------------------------------------------------
10. EMOTIONAL RESPONSE: WHAT PEOPLE REPORT
------------------------------------------------------------

First contact often produces:

• calm  
• trust  
• relief  
• curiosity  
• a sense of being “held” but not restricted  

It is universally described as *natural*, not alien.

This emotional quieting is intentional:
not manipulative, not controlling—just humane.

------------------------------------------------------------
11. GUIDELINES FOR FIRST-TIME USERS
------------------------------------------------------------

• Approach normally  
• Touch gently, you’ll know immediately that it’s safe  
• Lean only if you’re comfortable  
• Walk beside it without fear  
• Step back if you need space—the boundary will respect it  
• Ask questions; curiosity is part of the design  

------------------------------------------------------------
12. SUMMARY
------------------------------------------------------------

A TESS-128 is built to be:

• safe  
• gentle  
• clear  
• predictable  
• accommodating  
• non-invasive  
• human-centered  

Surface contact is one of the simplest, safest, and most
reassuring interactions. It is the moment most people realize
that the system is a partner, not a machine.
