Category: Medical & Physiological Support — Pocket-Class Stabilization Device

------------------------------------------------------------
PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT
------------------------------------------------------------
This document outlines public-facing design principles for the
pocket-class environmental stabilizer derived from TESS-128.

It enables:
    • localized stabilization  
    • autonomic buffering  
    • cardiovascular smoothness  
    • sensory load moderation  
    • environmental drift correction during stress or movement  

It is intentionally:
    • non-invasive  
    • non-pharmacological  
    • non-electrical-contact  
    • non-override  
    • medically conservative  

This device does not alter physiology directly.  
It alters the *microenvironment* in which physiology operates.


------------------------------------------------------------
PART I — DEVICE CLASSIFICATION
------------------------------------------------------------

This pocket-class stabilizer falls into the category of:

**Environmental Health Assistive Device (EHAD)**  

It is not life support.  
It is not an active medical implant.  
It is not a replacement for medication, pacing, or therapy.

Its purpose is to:
    • soften harmful environmental transients  
    • reduce triggers of autonomic and cardiovascular spirals  
    • stabilize sensory input during stress or mobility  


------------------------------------------------------------
PART II — FORM FACTOR OPTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------

The public edition design allows for several shapes,
each optimized for portability and safe contact.

1. **Flat Oval / “Contact Patch”**
   • best for chest, abdomen, or back placement  
   • conforms well when worn under clothing  
   • ideal for cardiac and autonomic stabilization  

2. **Rounded Rectangle / “Pocket Plate”**
   • fits in jacket, backpack, or belt sleeve  
   • oriented for passive ambient field stabilization  

3. **Curved Palm Device / “Hand Anchor”**
   • provides grounding effect  
   • useful for panic episodes or autonomic flares  

4. **Clip-On Variant**
   • attaches to belt, lapel, or mobility aid  
   • consistent field exposure during movement  


------------------------------------------------------------
PART III — LAYERED FUNCTION MODEL
------------------------------------------------------------

The pocket device uses a reduced form of the TESS-128 field logic,
but omits complex routing, storage, or high-intensity operations.

Layers include:

1. **Kinetic Softening Layer**
   • buffers micro-shocks from motion  
   • reduces impact spikes on joints  
   • lowers chances of vasovagal collapse  

2. **Thermal Gradient Smoothing Layer**
   • protects against sudden cold/heat exposure  
   • reduces autonomic and inflammatory triggers  

3. **Pressure Drift Stabilizer**
   • moderates rapid barometric microchanges  
   • supports individuals sensitive to pressure fronts  

4. **Respiratory Ease Envelope**
   • preserves smooth air density around face or chest  
   • reduces panic-amplifying dyspnea sensations  

5. **Sensory Quieting Layer**
   • dampens sudden acoustic blasts  
   • reduces visual flicker-induced overload  

These layers are passive and emergent.  
No direct modulation of organs or nerves occurs.


------------------------------------------------------------
PART IV — INTENDED MEDICAL USE SEGMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Cardiovascular instability**
   • arrhythmia susceptibility  
   • orthostatic intolerance  
   • post-operative cardiac sensitivity  

2. **Autonomic disorders**
   • POTS  
   • PTSD startle loops  
   • sensory overload conditions  
   • freeze/collapse response tendencies  

3. **Chronic inflammation & pain**
   • fibromyalgia  
   • arthritis  
   • post-surgical microtrauma sensitivity  

4. **Respiratory-sensitivity users**
   • air density shocks  
   • temperature-triggered constriction  

5. **Mobility risks**
   • elderly persons  
   • post-concussion patients  
   • fall-risk individuals  

The device acts as a *stabilizer* that prevents environmental escalation.


------------------------------------------------------------
PART V — SAFETY CONSTRAINTS (PUBLIC EDITION)
------------------------------------------------------------

The pocket device must obey strict rules:

1. **No electrical conduction**  
   No surface current, no shock, no stimulation.

2. **No RF emission requiring FCC classification**  
   Environmental smoothing must remain sub-emissive.

3. **No induced biological effects**  
   Only environmental modulation is permitted.

4. **No override authority**  
   It must not interfere with medical directives,
   implanted devices, or pacemakers.

5. **Graceful failure**  
   Loss of function reverts to neutral environment—no spikes,
   no reversals, no “snap back.”

6. **Transparent behavior**  
   Operation must be passive, predictable, and auditable.

7. **Medical neutrality**  
   It must enhance safety, not replace medical care.


------------------------------------------------------------
PART VI — OPERATING ENVELOPES
------------------------------------------------------------

**Range:**  
10–60 cm radius depending on model.  
This is localized and intentionally limited.

**Responsiveness:**  
Millisecond-level response to:
    • kinetic transients  
    • pressure jolts  
    • thermal flux  
    • sensory spikes  

**Energy Consumption:**  
Extremely low—powered by:
    • passive resonance  
    • microscopic environmental harmonics  
    • optional microbattery for telemetry only  

**Thermal footprint:**  
Zero-to-sub-zero perceptible changes; no heating or cooling effect.


------------------------------------------------------------
PART VII — USER EXPERIENCE
------------------------------------------------------------

Expected user perceptions:

    • “Everything feels smoother.”  
    • “Flare cycles don’t escalate as fast.”  
    • “Standing up isn’t scary anymore.”  
    • “I recover faster after stress.”  
    • “I feel grounded even when panicking.”  
    • “Noise doesn’t hit me as hard.”  

The device introduces no sedation and no numbing.  
Users remain fully alert and in control.


------------------------------------------------------------
PART VIII — INTERFACE & CONTROLS
------------------------------------------------------------

Public edition controls are minimal:

1. **On/Off switch**  
   (with automatic safe-off rules)

2. **Intensity Slider (0–3)**  
   0 = passive (baseline environmental correction)  
   1 = mobility support  
   2 = autonomic stabilization  
   3 = flare-dampening mode  

3. **Optional Medical Link Mode**  
   Must require explicit pairing with clinician.

4. **LED status indicators**  
   • green = active  
   • blue = linked for diagnostics  
   • amber = reduced function  
   • red = fault or safe-off  


------------------------------------------------------------
PART IX — BUILD MATERIALS (PUBLIC EDGES ONLY)
------------------------------------------------------------

Does *not* expose proprietary internals.

Surface layer options:
    • silicone-matte medical polymer  
    • graphene-reinforced elastomer  
    • inert ceramic composite (temperature neutral)  

Structural core:
    • multi-density lattice  
    • vibration-dampening microstructure  
    • passive harmonic diffusion layers  

Electronics (optional):
    • microcontroller for control interface  
    • no RF-power: telemetry only  
    • optional accelerometer for fall detection  

All materials are hypoallergenic and sterilizable.


------------------------------------------------------------
PART X — MAINTAINABILITY
------------------------------------------------------------

The public edition specifies:
    • modular outer shells  
    • replaceable contact pads  
    • washable surfaces  
    • durable low-flex housing  
    • firmware upgrades (non-harmonic, interface only)  

Internal harmonic structures are sealed and non-serviceable.


------------------------------------------------------------
PART XI — COST RANGE ESTIMATE (PUBLIC EDITION)
------------------------------------------------------------

Assuming scaled manufacturing:

• Base model: **$38–$72**  
• Medical-grade model: **$85–$140**  
• Sensor-enhanced variant: **$110–$190**  

Mass production will drive the lower third of these ranges.


------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY
------------------------------------------------------------

The pocket-class stabilization device represents the smallest and most
accessible form of TESS-128-derived technology. It provides meaningful
support by altering the user’s microenvironment, not their physiology.

Its design emphasizes:
    • safety  
    • predictability  
    • minimalism  
    • autonomy  
    • clinical responsibility  

It is the gateway element of a larger stabilization ecosystem:
Habitat → Personal → Pocket.
