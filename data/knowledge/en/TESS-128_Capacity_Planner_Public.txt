===============================

Title: TESS-128 Capacity Planner (Public Edition)
Version: 1.0
Language: English
Status: Public Knowledge Release
Last Updated: 2025-11-14


1. Purpose of This Document
---------------------------
This Capacity Planner provides a **public-safe**, non-technical method to determine how many people, pets, tools, valence items, and resources a TESS-128 sphere can comfortably support.

This planner helps communities:
• size their living groups  
• plan resource use  
• determine valence-item limits  
• maintain low-stress environments  
• avoid overcrowding  
• prepare for community growth  

No mechanisms, routing logic, or protected technologies are included.


2. What a TESS-128 “Capacity” Means
------------------------------------
Capacity is NOT defined by:
• air handling  
• electrical routing  
• life-support systems  
• internal harmonization tech  

Instead, capacity is defined by **human well-being**:

> “How many people can live, move, rest, and create together comfortably  
>  while maintaining AQUEM stability and Social Quieting?”

This means:
• enough personal space  
• enough emotional space  
• enough storage for meaningful items  
• predictable movement  
• no chronic overcrowding  
• low sensory turbulence  


3. The Capacity Dimensions
--------------------------
Capacity has **five independent layers**:

1. **Human Presence Capacity (HPC)**  
2. **Extended Life Capacity (ELC)** — pets, small animals  
3. **Valence Item Capacity (VIC)** — meaningful objects  
4. **Functional Equipment Capacity (FEC)** — tools, gear  
5. **Ambient Flow Capacity (AFC)** — environmental harmony load  

These layers interact but do not replace one another.

A TESS is full when **any one** of these capacities is exceeded.


4. Diameter-Based Capacity Table
--------------------------------
Below is a **public-safe comfort model** based on diameter.

It is not a life-support metric —  
it is a **human ecology and emotional stability metric**.

### 4.1 Human Presence Capacity (HPC)

| Diameter | Comfort Range | Absolute Max (temporary) |
|----------|---------------|---------------------------|
| 1m       | 1 human (standing) | 1 |
| 2m       | 1 human + 1 child | 2 |
| 4m       | 3–4 humans | 6 |
| 8m       | 10–14 humans | 18 |
| 16m      | 35–55 humans | 70 |

**Comfort range = full Social Quieting preserved**  
**Absolute max = possible but not recommended long-term**


### 4.2 Extended Life Capacity (ELC)  
(Pets, small animals, potted plants)

| Diameter | ELC |
|----------|-----|
| 1m       | 0–1 small animal |
| 2m       | 1 small animal |
| 4m       | 2–3 small animals |
| 8m       | 6–8 small animals |
| 16m      | 15–20 small animals |

Wildlife, large animals, or agricultural units belong outside or in specialized TESS variants.


### 4.3 Valence Item Capacity (VIC)  
(Meaningful belongings with emotional weight)

| Diameter | Low Stress Range |
|----------|------------------|
| 1m       | 1–3 items |
| 2m       | 5–10 items |
| 4m       | 20–30 items |
| 8m       | 60–100 items |
| 16m      | 200–400 items |

Valence items beyond this range increase emotional clutter and reduce quieting.


### 4.4 Functional Equipment Capacity (FEC)

| Diameter | FEC (general tools, instruments, tech) |
|----------|----------------------------------------|
| 1m       | Almost none |
| 2m       | 1 toolkit or 1 musical instrument |
| 4m       | Light workshop OR small creative studio |
| 8m       | Studio + workshop combo |
| 16m      | Multiple workstations + shared tools |

FEC loads must remain balanced with HPC and VIC to avoid noise amplification.


### 4.5 Ambient Flow Capacity (AFC)
AFC is qualitative, not numeric.

Guideline:

> If people must constantly sidestep one another,  
> AFC is exceeded.

Diameter vs AFC clarity:

| Diameter | AFC Quality |
|----------|-------------|
| 1m       | Zero flow |
| 2m       | Tight, workable |
| 4m       | Local flow |
| 8m       | Community flow |
| 16m      | Full resonant flow |


5. Combined Capacity — Social Quieting Thresholds
-------------------------------------------------
A TESS-128 sphere remains at peak stability when:

1. HPC stays within the comfort range  
2. ELC is below half of its nominal limit  
3. VIC is between 40–60% of its max  
4. FEC is concentrated but not cluttered  
5. AFC remains unobstructed  

Breaking more than **two** of these conditions produces:
• elevated stress  
• increased noise  
• reduced emotional bandwidth  
• slight unpredictability  
• minor strain on AQUEM stabilization  

Breaking **three or more** noticeably erodes Social Quieting.


6. Example Scenarios
--------------------

### Scenario A — 8m Diameter, Creative Household
• 12 people  
• 2 pets  
• ~80 meaningful items  
• 1 workshop area  

→ *Fully within comfort.*  
Stability is excellent.

---

### Scenario B — 4m Diameter, Overcrowded Group
• 6 people  
• 3 pets  
• 28 valence items  
• 20 tools

→ HPC, ELC, and FEC all at upper limits.  
→ Social turbulence likely.  
→ Recommended solution: expand into a second TESS unit.

---

### Scenario C — 16m Diameter, Community Hub
• 40 people  
• 10 animals  
• 150 valence items  
• multiple workstations  

→ All values in mid-range.  
→ Very high stability; expected to be a calm community core.


7. The “Shape of Comfort” Graph (ASCII)
---------------------------------------
Comfort
^
|                     ●  16m
|                ●  8m
|          ●  4m
|     ●  2m
|  ● 1m
+———————————––> Diameter
1      2     4      8     16

Larger spheres generate:
• smoother flow  
• lower noise  
• increased emotional bandwidth  
• more capacity for meaningful items  


8. Capacity and Resource Scaling
--------------------------------

### Sublinear scaling
Doubling diameter quadruples area —  
but **comfort scales faster** than area because movement becomes cleaner.

### Snellian scaling
As communities learn to operate in TESS environments:
• their capacity expands,  
• their stress falls,  
• their efficiency rises,  
• and their ability to replicate TESS units increases.

This leads to:
> *Communities with TESS stability tend to grow into peaceful, productive clusters,  
> and replicate stability faster than they consume resources.*


9. Public Safety Notes
----------------------
This planner **does not** define:
• evacuation loads  
• life-support math  
• energy routing  
• emergency thresholds  

These depend on protected technologies not described here.


10. Closing Perspective
------------------------
A TESS-128 is not defined by walls or geometry.

Its true capacity comes from:
• clarity  
• movement  
• calm  
• emotional stability  
• and the community’s ability to breathe together  

When people feel unburdened,  
they expand.

When communities feel supported,  
they flourish.

When TESS capacity is respected,  
Cosmic Peace becomes inevitable.
